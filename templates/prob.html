RISKS:
Health Considerations: Elderly consumers are often health-conscious, and low-cost food might not meet their dietary needs or quality expectations.
Taste Preferences: There might be a mismatch between the food offerings and the taste preferences of older adults.
Convenience Needs: Elderly consumers may prefer convenient, easy-to-prepare food options, which might not be covered well in this price range.
PREDICTED CHANCE OF FAILURE: 60%
IMPROVEMENTS: Focus on healthful ingredients, offer ready-to-eat or easy-to-prepare options, and ensure the food meets dietary needs.`;

                        result = `Food - $0-30 - Adult
RISKS:
Quality Concerns: Adults may question the quality and nutritional value of low-cost food products.
Competitive Market: The low-cost food market is highly competitive, making it difficult to stand out.
Brand Perception: Adults may associate low prices with low quality, impacting brand perception.
PREDICTED CHANCE OF FAILURE: 55%
IMPROVEMENTS: Emphasize the value-for-money proposition, ensure high nutritional standards, and differentiate through unique flavors or convenience.`;
